    <>Imagine that you own an exchange and earn commission from each trade</>
  ),
  fullDesc: (
    <>
      Stable coins are allocated across
      <br />
      decentralized exchanges
      <br />
      (Uniswap, dydx, etc.) and are split in trading pairs (ETH/USDC, USDC/Dai,
      etc). Each exchange charges a commission on each trade in such pairs and
      shares the commission with you. Afford strategy may include other
      investment instruments which are introduced after DAO voting
    </>
  ),
  benefits: (
    <>
      - instant withdrawal
      <br />- limited exposure to volatile assets (e.g. ETH, if selected in
      traded pair), smoothed by earned trading commissions
      <br />- higher returns with longer investment periods
    </>
  ),
